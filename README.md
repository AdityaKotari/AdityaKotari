# Hello 👋
I'm a sophomore at NIT Silchar. Feel free to reach out to me for whatever. I think emojis are cringe but I do think it makes things more readable here. 
### Here are some of my most interesting projects: 

* [ADCLU](https://github.com/AdityaKotari/ADCLU): A Java/Maven Command Line Uitility that can currently do the following:
  * Manage a list of tasks 📝
  * Find the diff for two files 


* [Flush](https://github.com/AdityaKotari/flush): A PWA that can be used to store and locate restroom locations and also provide an interface for property owners to lease out restrooms. Uses Google Maps API. 
  * 🏆 Won the ["Best Open Innovation Hack"](https://devfolio.co/submissions/flush-cde7) at HackNITR 2.0 

* [Trash Overflow](https://github.com/AdityaKotari/trash-overflow): Another PWA that acts as a platform to provide and request cleaning/sanitation/garbage related services.
  * 🏆 Won [2nd position](https://www.facebook.com/groups/186753138074295/permalink/4107101392706097/) at CSS Hacks 2021 
  
 ### Some other stuff: 
 
 * [Twitter wordcloud](https://github.com/AdityaKotari/twitter-wordcloud): An Express web-app that fetches tweets and visualizes the most common words in a word cloud.
