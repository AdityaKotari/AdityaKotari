# Hi! I'm Aditya Kotari 👋

🧝 I enjoy coding projects that blend full stack development, machine learning and/or mixed reality to create completely novel solutions 

🌟 I also really enjoyed participating in hackathons or interesting hobby projects. Having a few days or less to (recruit colleagues > brainstorm ideas > design architecture > develop > deploy > present) was a lot of fun. I'm open to collaborating on cool weekend projects if they're interesting!  

🦾 Some of the tech I've worked with are: 
- AWS and Java during my time as a SDE at Amazon, PyTorch, Tensorflow, MERN, Django, AngularJS, Java/Kotlin for Android Development, Three.js for research or hobby projects
