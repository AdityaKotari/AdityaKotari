# Hi! I'm Aditya Kotari 👋

🧝 I enjoy coding projects that blend full stack development, machine learning and/or mixed reality to create completely novel solutions 

🌟 I also really enjoyed participating in hackathons during my undergrad. Having a few days or less to (recruit colleagues > brainstorm ideas > design architecture > develop > deploy) was a lot of fun. I'm open to collaborating on cool weekend projects if they're interesting!  

🦾 Some of the tech I've worked with are: PyTorch, Tensorflow, MERN, Django, AngularJS, Java/Kotlin for android development, and Three.js  

📜 My CV for convenience: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LAf4QZ53nr20bA1hSVAx79UbR1tXINRR/view?usp=sharing)
